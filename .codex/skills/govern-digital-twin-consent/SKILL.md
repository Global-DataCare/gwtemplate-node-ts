# Govern Digital Twin Consent

## Mandatory TDD

Use red-green-refactor TDD for every behavior or flow change. Write and run the smallest executable contract test first; it must fail for the intended reason before implementation begins. Then implement the minimum change and make focused, integration and affected end-to-end tests green. Begin every new or modified test suite with a flow-contract comment. Begin every Playwright or other E2E file with the complete numbered journey and its authorization and persistence invariants. Mocks may isolate units but never replace real boundary proof. Never make a test green by accepting an error, placeholder, pending setup or other incomplete terminal state.

## Read before acting

Read the current files in both repositories:

- GW CORE:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `docs/01-OVERVIEW-AND-GUIDES/101-01.I-LIFECYCLE.md`
  - `docs/90.F-UC_CAPABILITY_MATRIX_SEDIA.md`
  - `src/utils/consent-storage.ts`
  - `src/utils/digital-twin-secondary-use.ts`
  - `src/utils/digital-twin-research-projection.ts`
- Node SDK:
  - `docs/101-DIGITAL_TWIN_SDK.md`
  - `tests/101-digital-twin-sdk.test.mjs`
  - `src/digital-twin.ts`
  - `src/resource-operations.ts`
  - `src/orchestration/individual-controller-sdk.ts`

Verify current branches, versions and published npm state before release claims.

## Preserve the application contract

- Accept only the product-level browser choice `{ enabled: boolean }`.
- Resolve the authenticated subject, index-provider organization and enrollment state in the BFF. Never accept them from browser JSON.
- Keep portal facade names product-neutral: `/subject` owns the individual,
  `/research` owns researcher operations, `/host/*` owns host administration
  and `/test-network/*` owns Test Network governance. Product-branded paths are
  compatibility aliases only. Domain profiles may specialize `individual`
  without changing the consent or twin contract.
- Call `IndividualControllerSdk.setDigitalTwinSecondaryUseConsent(...)` with `decision: 'permit' | 'deny'`.
- Author one FHIR `Consent` through `resource.meta.claims` and `entry.meta.claims`:
  - `Consent.subject`: authenticated operational subject DID
  - `Consent.actor-identifier`: organization/tenant that provides the subject index
  - `Consent.actor-role`: `*`
  - `Consent.purpose`: `HRESCH`
  - `Consent.action`: canonical `ServiceCapability.DigitalTwinReader`
- `Consent.decision`: `permit` or `deny`
- `Consent.source-reference`: stable portal/software/study URL or URI
- Do not add an ODRL attachment to this provider-level secondary-use Consent.
- Do not introduce `researchOrganizationDid` into the patient toggle. Distinguish each portal, software product or study with its own `Consent.source-reference`.

## Resolve the Consent from its application/study reference

- The BFF passes `researchUseReference`, a stable URL or URI identifying its portal, software product or study.
- GW resolves the rule by subject, index provider, HRESCH, DigitalTwinReader and `Consent.source-reference`.
- GW alone assigns and reuses the internal `Consent.identifier`; the BFF never generates, stores, sends or receives it.
- Reusing the same source reference updates one rule. A different source reference creates a separate FHIR Consent.
- Status lookup must include active deny rules; "active" is validity/period state and must not be confused with `decision=permit`.
- Read status through an individual `Communication` carrying
  `Subject/_search` FHIR Parameters for subject, index provider, HRESCH,
  DigitalTwinReader and source reference. Match canonical or contextualized
  FHIR claim keys. Consent is not part of clinical
  `Bundle/_search`, and the individual Subject is not a twin ResearchSubject.

## Keep projection separate from consent

- Ingest the operational IPS through the existing individual `Communication/_batch` flow, normally via `ingestCommunicationAndUpdateIndex(...)`.
- Let GW create or refresh the research projection when consent is `permit`.
- Absence of an explicit permit is disabled; never project by default.
- Create one canonical Composition per IPS document/version with all IPS sections. Never create one Composition per section.
- Assign the twin subject only inside GW from its tenant-private alias as a registered `urn:uuid:<uuid>`.
- Reject operational DIDs, caller-invented UUIDs and unregistered UUIDs on canonical research records.
- Never teach a patient portal to submit an IPS Bundle or canonical Composition to `digitaltwin/.../Composition/_batch`.
- Treat the direct Composition batch only as explicitly scoped adapter/compatibility plumbing for a pre-authorized registered twin; keep it outside the portal 101.

## Preserve MVP discovery and organization authorization

- Use one public search contract for discovery and saved selections:
  `digitaltwin/.../ResearchSubject/_search` with a FHIR `Parameters` body.
- A ResearchSubject is the public twin aggregate. Its `composition` declares
  `resourceType: "Composition"` and is the canonical Composition GW uses to index it and connect its
  projected resources; do not expose `Composition/_search` as the app contract.
- `saveSelection(...)` selects a ResearchSubject. Its private persistence may
  use a researcher-owned Composition, but `searchSelections(...)` reopens it
  through the same public `ResearchSubject/_search` route.
- For employee-specific selections, search with `section` plus
  `Composition.meta-tag`; the SDK binds `Composition.author` to the employee
  DID and GW verifies it against the authenticated SMART `sub`.
- The default SMART reader scope is
  `organization/ResearchSubject.rs?subject=*`; the SDK also completes an
  explicitly supplied bare `organization/ResearchSubject.rs` to that form.
- Basic search accepts one or more IPS section tokens, inclusive `date-from`,
  optional inclusive `date-to`, and non-empty `text`.
- Sections use OR. Text and date use AND and must match the same clinical
  resource. Resolve an omitted end date to GW current time.
- A section may map to several resource families. Never require the BFF to
  choose or know a resource type for basic search.
- Append private derived text/date/language properties to the same projected resource record
  during projection. They are not a separate collection or a
  second index, and `__digitalTwinSearch.*` is never a public FHIR claim family.
  Consume those properties only for Composition-wide matching and strip them
  from search matches and materialized resources.
- Keep age range and host-wide aggregation out of the MVP.
- For a tenant DID created before ResearchSubject became the public aggregate,
  accept its existing read-only digitaltwin Composition `_search` declaration
  as authorization for replacement `ResearchSubject/_search`; do not require
  tenant reactivation or DCR and do not widen mutation authority. Startup
  reconciliation must publish the canonical route, remove obsolete
  resource-specific twin search routes and preserve unrelated custom services.
- Reconcile every persisted tenant's canonical sector service catalog at
  startup even without split-runtime overrides. Remove obsolete
  resource-specific twin search declarations and preserve unrelated custom DID
  services.
- Same-tenant access uses verified employee proof. Foreign access also needs a
  matching FHIR Contract VC and provider authorization.
- Recover the full hosted organization DID from both `:employee:` and
  `:member:` actor DIDs. A root `did:web` domain is only an alias/discovery
  identity and must not turn a same-tenant employee into a foreign consumer.
- Treat DID parsing only as routing evidence. Extract the VAT/tax tenant id,
  employee email-derived `z...` identifier and role from either the internal
  hosted form or the public `organization:(taxid|vatid):<VAT>` form; never use
  the hostname as organization authority or compare whole DID aliases.
- Same-tenant access additionally requires an active employee in the extracted
  tenant vault. Recompute `urn:multibase:z...` from that encrypted employee's
  normalized email, match the extracted role, and require the verified
  `EmployeeCredential.sameAs` to carry the same stable identifier.
- Emit signer roles `provider-authorized-signatory` and
  `consumer-authorized-signatory`; accept `provider-controller` and
  `consumer-controller` only as deprecated read aliases.
- Require two already-verified `contractAgreement` proofs over the same
  immutable Contract VC. `RESPRSN` proves technical tenant control, not legal
  authority to sign, unless a separate verified delegation explicitly grants it.

## Preserve lifecycle semantics

- `deny` is reversible disable: pause later synchronization, retain the private alias and freeze published anonymous data.
- A later `permit` reuses the alias and rebuilds from current operational data.
- `purgeDigitalTwinSubjectLink(...)` is provider offboarding only: delete the private operational-subject to twin correspondence, never anonymous research data.
- A later enrollment after purge receives a new twin UUID and cannot reconnect the old projection.
- Administrative cleanup of erroneous direct records must resolve the exact tenant, section, document ids and subject first. Delete only proven erroneous index records; do not represent cleanup as patient purge, and do not claim immutable audit anchors were erased.

## Preserve authored clinical deletion

- For the current direct `updateClinicalSummary(...)` call, set `sender` to
  the operational `ActorSession.actorDid` returned with the authenticated
  role-specific profile, never a stable multibase URN or a DID/alias owned by
  the portal. This applies equally to controller, member/caregiver and
  professional sessions. Set `recipient` to the real provider-tenant DID inside
  the host that accommodates that tenant, never the host DID or a portal alias.
  The subject remains the individual DID.
- To edit an imported IPS in a demo, first call
  `cloneImportedClinicalDocumentForDemo(...)` with that same session
  `actorDid`. The helper gives the copy new resource ids and sets
  `Composition.author` to that `actorDid`; it never rewrites the imported source
  document.
- Require a locally declared `Composition.author` to equal the authenticated
  actor DID before first persistence. An anonymous bearer or body claim never
  becomes author evidence.
- Preserve an imported external `urn:*` author as provenance only. The local
  importer cannot update or delete that record merely by repeating the URN.
- Apply the same stored-author check to updates as to deletes; never overwrite
  first and attempt authorization afterwards.
- Use `Bundle.type = batch`; each entry independently selects `.create()`, `.update()` or `.delete()`. Do not turn this flow into a transaction.
- A typed delete addresses exactly `ResourceType/id`, has no resource body and may carry `.ifMatch(versionId)`.
- Store only the creator DID in the clinical resource as `Composition.author`. Never store email, phone or their stable hashes in that resource.
- At delete time, authorize the exact subject and creator. Resolve linked verified email/phone login channels from private identity metadata outside the resource, so phone-created and email-created data remain manageable after account linking.
- In that protected metadata, store the actor/member UUID, a distinct
  relationship or professional-assignment UUID, its owner and governed role.
  Operational DIDs, verified contacts, DCR clients and `kid` values are aliases
  only. Consent targets the assignment UUID plus its separate role.
- Require an employee/member import or authorized onboarding record before DCR
  may link a stable creator binding. DCR can add its verified client, actor DID
  and public `kid` aliases to the exact existing binding; it cannot create or
  alter the actor UUID, assignment UUID, owner or role.
- At IPS export time, replace a locally stored operational author DID with the
  bound FHIR author reference and include RelatedPerson or
  PractitionerRole/Practitioner resources. Preserve unbound external source
  authors exactly; never rewrite author identity during direct ingestion.
- Remove the exact fact from later operational summaries and the synchronized research projection when enabled. This is neither secondary-use `deny` nor provider-offboarding link purge.
- Keep 101 documentation at application level: actor, subject, hosted
  provider-tenant recipient, typed batch entry, authorization result and
  visible summary behavior, without DIDComm rendering, vault, queue or hashing
  plumbing.

## Keep every artifact aligned

For any contract change, update together:

- manager/utility tests and route integration tests in GW CORE;
- SDK JSDoc and exported types/functions;
- executable `tests/101-digital-twin-sdk.test.mjs` showing that the BFF stores only its stable research-use reference;
- copyable snippets in `docs/101-DIGITAL_TWIN_SDK.md`;
- GW high-level lifecycle and SEDIA capability matrix;
- README public-surface inventory and changelogs;
- this skill in both repository-local copies.

Search for stale claims before finishing, especially `researchOrganizationDid`, `secondaryUseClaimKey`, ODRL in the provider toggle, operational `Composition.subject`, one Composition per section, and portal calls to direct digitaltwin Composition batch.

## Verification

- Run targeted GW consent, projection and Composition route tests plus typecheck/build/Swagger when the GW contract changes.
- Run SDK build, product-neutrality, typecheck, executable 101 and full tests when the SDK surface changes.
- Confirm branch, commit, push and merge state in each changed repository.
- For npm, verify `npm view <package>@<version>`, `dist.integrity`, `latest`, a clean install and the exported public surface before declaring publication.
- For deployed cleanup or behavior, verify the exact target runtime tuple and
  never infer product identity from a legacy project, cluster or workload name.
