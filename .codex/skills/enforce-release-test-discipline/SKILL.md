description: Enforce branch, TDD, canonical FHIR and schema.org vocabulary, fixture, test-layer, product-neutrality, changelog, semantic-version, npm publication, deployment and merge discipline across GW CORE, shared gdc SDKs and product portals. Use for every behavior fix, FHIR-like resource or search contract, flow change, test or 101 example, documentation contract, shared-package release, portal dependency promotion, App Hosting rollout, or request to ship with branch, patch, changelog and merge to main.

# Enforce Release and Test Discipline

## Start on a branch

1. Read the repository `AGENTS.md` and applicable product/contract skill.
2. Inspect the worktree and preserve unrelated user changes.
3. Update local knowledge of the remote, start from the intended current base,
   and create a named branch before editing.
4. Never implement or commit directly on `main`. If that already happened,
   disclose it; do not rewrite published history to manufacture a merge.

## Write the contract test first

- Use red-green-refactor for every behavior or flow change. Run the smallest
  executable test and retain the intended failure before implementation.
- Make this the first physical line of every new or modified test file:
  `// Flow contract: reuse shared test fixtures and canonical types; do not introduce duplicated literals.`
- Import synthetic identities, routes, DIDs, tokens, codes, dates and other
  governed examples from the canonical shared test-data/example module.
  Prefer the applicable `*-data-utils-ts` package or
  `gdc-common-utils-ts/examples`; add a missing fixture there once instead of
  repeating a local literal.
- Import defined enums, constants, claim names, resource types, transport
  profiles and HTTP methods from their owning package. Never restate their wire
  strings merely to make a test pass.
- Preserve the primary-document Bundle boundary: a DIDComm payload body is one
  FHIR-like/JSON-primary-document Bundle, and each successful result belongs in
  `body.data[].resource` (or canonical FHIR `entry[].resource`). Never place a
  second `{ total, data }` search list inside `BundleEntry.resource` except in
  the isolated, explicitly deprecated rolling-deployment serializer. Add a
  negative assertion against `resource.data` for the current profile and prove
  the legacy profile separately without teaching it in high-level snippets.
- Literal values are allowed only when the literal itself is the behavior under
  test, such as malformed input or an exact serialization assertion. State
  that reason beside it.

## Preserve standard vocabularies

- Before authoring a FHIR-like resource, property, status, search parameter or
  flat claim, verify the exact name and value against the applicable official
  HL7 FHIR version and the canonical catalog already exported by
  `gdc-common-utils-ts`. Do the same for schema.org types and properties.
- Never invent a FHIR resource name, pseudo-resource namespace such as
  `AccessRequest.*`, property, status or search parameter. FHIR-like flat
  claims keep the owning HL7 resource and original API/search parameter name;
  they do not create a parallel vocabulary.
- When R4 and R5 differ, state the selected profile explicitly and use only a
  value valid for that profile. For a shared claims-first contract, choose a
  deliberately supported cross-version representation and prove both
  projections. Never infer a value from a different FHIR release.
- Introduce an extension only after proving that neither FHIR nor schema.org
  covers the requirement. Give it an explicit canonical extension URL,
  document ownership and compatibility, add it to the shared catalog first,
  and keep it visibly separate from native standard fields.
- Model a professional permission request as one auditable `Communication`
  carrying a Bundle of ordinary `Consent.status=draft` resources. Draft
  Consent describes requested rules and grants no access. Only the
  controller-approved active Consent enters authorization evaluation; the
  historical status-less rule is read-only migration compatibility.
- Add regression assertions that reject invented namespaces and that prove
  non-active Consent states cannot authorize. Cite the official vocabulary in
  JSDoc and high-level docs, while tests import the governed constants instead
  of copying wire literals.

## Enforce claims-first persistence

- Treat `resource.meta.claims` as the canonical business source of truth for
  every claims-first GW request and response. A manager must persist those flat
  claims in `ConfidentialStorageDoc.content.claims`; it must not discard them
  and replace them with a version-specific nested FHIR resource.
- Pass incoming flat claims through the existing
  `normalizeContextualizedClaims` canonical FHIR-claim validation before
  `protectConfidentialData`. Reuse its `normalizeFhirApiClaimKey` contract;
  never create a manager-local or parallel validator.
- Build `indexed.attributes` only from the governed searchable subset of those
  claims and pass that subset through `protectAttributesNameAndValue` before
  repository persistence. Never expose plaintext searchable claim names or
  values outside encrypted content.
- Materialize native FHIR only at an explicit import, projection, or export
  adapter boundary. `validateFhirResource` validates native FHIR at that
  boundary, not the canonical flat-claims representation. Native FHIR input
  may be normalized into flat claims, but it never replaces flat claims as the
  stored source of truth.
- Make this an obligatory gate for every new persistence manager. Before its
  implementation can pass review, add a focused test that inspects the exact
  argument sent to `protectConfidentialData`, proves `content.claims` is the
  canonical payload, proves protected `indexed.attributes`, and rejects nested
  FHIR fields as persisted business state. Add the corresponding route test and
  keep an affected real local E2E with no skip.

## Keep test layers separate

- Enforce the same portal progression everywhere: `test -> local-network -> test-network -> network`.
  First run unit and integration tests with `networkKind=test`, then prove the
  normal local UI -> BFF -> high-level SDK -> GW/DataConv journey with real
  Playwright, in-memory services and no blockchain.
  Fixture pages, mocked routes and API-only Playwright are diagnostics and
  never satisfy this cross-system gate. Run Fabric/local-network only after it
  is green; staging repeats the journey after deployment, and production is
  last.
- Enable and execute every affected package or SDK live E2E against the real
  local services before releasing it. A live E2E reported as `SKIP` means the
  release gate failed; it is not passing evidence. Complete these live E2E
  gates before `npm publish` or any container image build.
- To fail fast across unpublished packages, use an immutable `npm pack` tarball
  only as a temporary `--no-save` consumer install. After the test, restore the
  registry dependency and lockfile and prove a clean diff: no `file:`, Git,
  workspace or vendored dependency may be committed. Publish only after unit,
  integration and local browser gates are green; reinstall the exact registry
  version, repeat the reproducible gate, and only then run `local-network` and
  staging.
- After a failure, resume at the smallest failed gate. Rerun predecessor gates
  only when they create required state, the fix changes an earlier boundary, or
  environment state is no longer trustworthy. Run the complete suite once at
  branch closure.
- Preserve identity roles at every transport boundary: DIDComm `from` is a
  sender DID, JWT `iss` is the signing entity, `kid` is a concrete key DID URL,
  and SMART `sub` is the authorized actor. Native FHIR Communication/Bundle
  inputs carry none of those DIDComm fields; HTTP Authorization proves the
  caller and `Communication.sender` keeps its FHIR business meaning.
- For generated clinical content, resolve Composition provenance from the
  protected registered creator binding. The closed `owner | creator` BFF choice
  is compatibility only: member/controller content may use one registered
  RelatedPerson as both author and attester; professional content keeps the
  jurisdictional CDS legal-organization URN as author and its registered
  PractitionerRole as attester. Never accept an arbitrary author reference
  from UI input or infer it from actorDid.
- Correction authority is separate from authorship: a registered member with
  the same individual owner or an authorized tenant professional may create a
  new version. Delete remains exact-author only. Preserve the new version's
  real author/attester and the verified submitter audit.
- Communication-carried clinical Bundles submit one sanitized primary-document
  `data[]` batch. The smart contract must process every entry as an individual
  asset keyed by that resource CID in one transaction; never persist `fullUrl`
  or confidential FHIR content. Do not publish `resource.meta.claims`; only the
  positive ledger-safe `meta.tag[]` allowlist and SHA3-384 multihashes in
  historical `relationships`/`ownerships` may cross that
  boundary. Keep author, attester, custodian, sender, verified submitter,
  signing-key and subject-ownership links distinct; never send their raw DID,
  URN, URL, key id or contact value. UUID-backed references must hash the
  canonical 16 UUID bytes so bare, `urn:uuid`, FHIR-relative and
  `:instance:<uuid>` forms converge for the same UUID. Keep the professional
  assignment link (PractitionerRole UUID), employee/person link (employee UUID)
  and organization link (complete CDS legal-organization URN) distinct.
  `artifact-sc.relationships.attester[]` must join the assignment asset in
  `employee-sc`; that asset joins employee and organization, and
  `subjectkeybinding-sc` repeats the same three opaque links beside `keyId`.
  Expose
  the real Fabric transaction id. A memory-adapter
  receipt is local proof only and must never be reported as on-chain evidence.
- Ledger channel and smart-contract selection is manager-owned policy. Managers
  derive the channel from trusted normalized domain context and select the
  canonical contract internally. Never accept either name from a request, BFF,
  SDK or deployment environment variable. Contract tests must poison legacy
  channel/chaincode variables and still prove the canonical selection.
- Keep the GW authenticated-authorship 101, Node BFF clinical-writes 101,
  public JSDoc, test journey comments, snippets, README summaries and the
  repository-local provenance skill mutually linked and synchronized.

- High-level `101`, documentation snippets and E2E journeys use only public
  application/SDK facades and assert user-visible or contract-visible results.
  They must not provision wallets, decode compact JOSE, record raw fetch calls,
  construct internal routes, inspect queues/vaults or instantiate transport
  adapters.
- Put algorithm and helper behavior in unit tests.
- Put HTTP serialization, encrypted transport, persistence adapters and route
  boundaries in focused integration tests.
- Put complete cross-system behavior in numbered E2E journeys with explicit
  authorization and persistence invariants. Mocks never count as boundary
  proof.
- Do not make high-level examples green by embedding internal plumbing. Move
  that proof to the correct lower-level suite and leave the high-level example
  copyable.

## Preserve shared-package neutrality

- Never place a product name, branded hostname, product route or product policy
  in GW CORE or a shared `gdc-*` package, including tests, examples, docs,
  comments and changelogs.
- Use neutral shared fixtures and enforce the rule with a repository check.
- Keep product-specific names and behavior only in the owning product repo.

## Release the complete change

Treat closure as one indivisible gate: one behavior or flow branch owns one
patch release, and no new fix or feature branch may start until the current one
has completed red-green TDD, every required no-skip test layer, changelog,
package and lockfile patch, branch commit and push, any required immutable npm
publication and clean-install verification, exact downstream pins, explicit
merge commit, pushed `main`, matching remote refs and a clean worktree.

When more than one reusable package changes, publish from the lowest changed
dependency upward. The next package or deployable consumer may be changed only
after the previous immutable version exists in the registry and its integrity
and exported surface have been verified.

1. Update the owning changelog with tested behavior. Shared changelogs remain
   product-neutral.
2. Run focused tests, affected integration/E2E tests, full tests, typecheck,
   build and neutrality/skill checks required by the repository. Enable every
   affected live E2E and reject a run containing `SKIP` before release.
3. Commit on the branch and push the branch.
4. Merge the reviewed branch into `main` with an explicit merge commit unless
   repository policy requires a PR merge. Push `main` and verify both remote
   refs and a clean worktree.
5. For a reusable bug fix, publish the next immutable patch version from a real
   TTY. Verify `npm view <package>@<version>`, integrity, the `latest` tag,
   clean registry installation and exported surface.
6. Pin deployable consumers to the exact registry version and update their
   lockfiles. Never substitute GitHub, `file:`, workspace or vendored tarball
   dependencies for a released package.
   When a product gateway is a long-lived fork of GW CORE or another gateway,
   never merge or cherry-pick the upstream release commit into the product
   branch. Start from a clean, current product `main`, inspect the exact
   upstream diff, and reproduce only the applicable semantic changes in the
   corresponding destination files. Preserve product-specific behavior,
   fixtures, documentation and deployment profiles; prove the port with the
   product's own tests and review its resulting diff before commit.
7. Verify the actual deployment/revision and live boundary before reporting
   completion.

Report separately: branch, commit, pushed branch, merge commit, pushed
`main`, package version/integrity, consumer pin, deployment and live result.

## Mandatory release authorization continuity

For any release chain that requires npm authorization, make at most three
attempts and keep each command session and browser window alive for up to five
minutes. Never end the turn or imply continued work while a window is pending.
After all three attempts fail, keep the release unpublished and continue the
local `test` stage with an immutable `npm pack` tarball. Never commit a
`file:`, Git, workspace or vendored tarball dependency.

Follow the canonical contract in
[`docs/LOCAL_FIRST_RELEASE_CONTRACT.md`](../../../docs/LOCAL_FIRST_RELEASE_CONTRACT.md):

- Do not attempt `npm publish` until every affected local `test` gate is
  green, including unit, integration, local services, real UI and Playwright.
- An npm publish or authorization failure must never stop the `test` stage.
- Continue unit, integration, local service, UI and Playwright gates with the
  immutable tarball installed `--no-save` on pushed but unmerged branches.
- The `npm pack` tarball is temporary: install it `--no-save`, then restore
  the registry dependency and lockfile before committing dependency state.
- After a failure, resume only the smallest failed gate; do not repeat a green
  gate unless the fix changed its boundary, it creates required state, or the
  environment is no longer trustworthy.
- Resume the failed gate; rerun a predecessor only for required state, a
  changed earlier boundary or an untrustworthy environment.
- After publication, install the exact registry version and run only the minimal
  install/export smoke; do not repeat the green local matrix unless the
  published artifact differs from the tested tarball or invalidates that
  evidence.
- Missing exact registry publication blocks only consumer merge, image build,
  `local-network`, `test-network`/staging and `network` promotion.
- A gateway consumer installs the exact registry version before its merge,
  image build and `local-network`. A portal consumer may retain the immutable
  tarball on its pushed, unmerged branch throughout `local-network`; after
  `local-network` is green, it installs the exact registry version and runs
  only the artifact smoke before its merge and staging.
- Publish only after the local matrix is green, install the exact registry
  version in the gateway before `local-network`, and install it in portals
  before staging.
- Registry order is dependency publish and verification, then consumer install
  and lockfile pin, then package merge, consumer merge, image build and deploy.
- Every test file's first line must be a `Flow contract:` comment linking this
  policy. Apply TDD red -> green -> refactor: red must fail because the
  production behavior is absent or wrong; green must prove the production
  contract. A skip, accepted error, placeholder, pending setup, fixture-only UI
  or mock replacing a real boundary is never green.
- Reuse canonical types and terminology from HL7/FHIR, LOINC, SNOMED CT,
  ICD-10, WHO ATC, Schema.org or the applicable governed standard before
  inventing a local type, enum, code, identifier or vocabulary.
- Put missing reusable types in the versioned domain data package or
  `common-utils`, with tests in that owning shared package, before downstream
  use.
- Reuse canonical fixtures, builders, claims, identifiers and vocabulary from
  the versioned domain data package (`<version>-data` or
  `<version>-data-utils`) or `common-utils`; no duplicated literals are
  allowed. If the reusable datum does not exist, add it first to its owning
  shared package with tests and consume that export downstream.
