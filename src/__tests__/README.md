# API and Testing Strategy Overview

This document outlines the complete architecture and testing strategy for the API, focusing on its asynchronous FAPI-compliant nature, data models, and multi-tenant design. It also includes information about the specific tests for organization registration.

## 1. Overall Architecture & FAPI Flow

The API is designed as a **non-blocking, asynchronous service** following the FAPI (Financial-grade API) pattern.

The flow is as follows:

1.  **Initial Request**: A client sends an `HTTP POST` to a specific action endpoint (e.g., `.../Practitioner/_batch`). The body contains a secure DIDComm envelope.
2.  **Immediate `202 Accepted`**: The server validates the request, queues the job, and immediately responds with `HTTP 202 Accepted` and a `thid` (thread ID).
3.  **Polling for Response**: The client then makes one or more `HTTP POST` requests to the **`_search`** action endpoint for that resource (e.g., `.../Practitioner/_search`). The body of this polling request contains the `thid`.
4.  **Final `200 OK`**: Once the job is complete, the `_search` endpoint responds with `HTTP 200 OK` and the final result.

## 2. API Path Structure

The API uses a structured, versioned, and multi-tenant path that explicitly declares the data format being used:

`/<tenant_id>/<cds>-<jurisdiction>/<version>/<sector>/<section>/<format>/<resourceType>/<_action>`

*   **`tenant_id`**: The `alternateName` of the tenant (e.g., `org1`).
*   **`cds-jurisdiction`**: Common Data Service and jurisdiction (e.g., `cds-es`).
*   **`version`**: API version (e.g., `v1`).
*   **`sector`**: Industry sector (e.g., `healthcare`).
*   **`section`**: Data domain within the sector (e.g., `entity`, `clinical`).
*   **`format`**: The data specification context (e.g., `org.schema.person`, `org.hl7.fhir.r4`).
*   **`resourceType`**: The type of resource being handled (e.g., `Practitioner`, `Group`).
*   **`_action`**: The operation (`_batch`, `_search`).

## 3. The DIDComm Envelope

All data is exchanged inside a secure DIDComm envelope, which is a signed JWT. This ensures the authenticity and integrity of every message.

*   **Header (`alg`, `kid`, `typ`):** Specifies the signing algorithm and the key ID of the sender.
*   **Payload (`iss`, `aud`, `thid`, `body`):**
    *   `iss`: The issuer (who sent the message).
    *   `aud`: The audience (the intended recipient, i.e., this API).
    *   `thid`: The unique ID for the request-response thread.
    *   `body`: The core payload of the message. For our API, this is a lean, command-style data, where `_batch` operations uses an `entry` with `meta.claims` with `@context`, `@type` and data.

## 4. Tenant & Admin Onboarding

The system bootstraps itself from the environment configuration. A user does not register the first tenant.

1.  **System Startup**: On startup, the service checks for the presence of `DEMO_ORG1_*` variables in the environment (`.env` file).
2.  **Automatic Bootstrapping**: If these variables exist, the service automatically calls the `TenantManager` to register the initial tenant (`ORG1`) and the `EmployeeManager` to create its designated administrator employee.
3.  **Further Tenants**: Subsequent tenants are registered by an authorized administrator from an existing, trusted tenant. The process is detailed in the [Organization Registration Process Documentation](src/docs/organization_registration.md).

## 5. Employee & Group Management (`_batch` Endpoint)

All entity management is done via a `_batch` endpoint.

*   **Offline-First:** This approach is designed for offline-first applications. A client app can batch any number of create/update/delete operations into a single `Bundle` and send it when a connection is available.
*   **Lean, Command-Style Bundle:** The `Bundle` sent by our applications is lean. Each `entry` contains:
    *   `fullUrl`: The URN of the entity.
    *   `meta.claims`: A self-contained object with `@context`, `@type`, and the actual data claims. The server is responsible for normalizing these claims for storage.
    *   `request`: The method, e.g., `{ "method": "PUT" }`.

## 6. Client-Centric Data Model

The architecture makes a critical distinction between organizational and personal data.

*   **Tenant Vaults:** A tenant (e.g., `ORG1`) has its own vault containing its operational data: employees, professional groups, roles, etc.
*   **Client Vaults:** A client (a person) has their own **independent vault**. Their ID is their vault ID. This vault is created for them by a custodian tenant (`ORG1`).
*   **Connection Channels (`List`):** To connect a client with professional groups, a `List` resource is created *inside the client's vault*. This list contains references to `Group` resources, which may exist in the client's own vault (e.g., "Family Group") or in a tenant's vault (e.g., on office with distinct professionals). This maintains the client's sovereignty over their own data connections.

## 7. Test-Driven Development (TDD) Principles

This project uses Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure high-quality and maintainable code. Here's how TDD is applied:

*   **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle:**
    *   **Red:** Write a test that expresses a desired behavior. This test will initially fail because the code doesn't exist yet.
    *   **Green:** Write the minimum amount of code to make the test pass. Focus on functionality, not optimization.
    *   **Refactor:** Clean up the code, improve its structure, and remove any duplication, while ensuring that all tests continue to pass.
*   **Test First:** Always write the test before writing the implementation.
*   **Small Increments:** Write small, focused tests and implement code in small, manageable chunks.
*   **Continuous Testing:** Run tests frequently to catch errors early.

By following these principles, we aim to create a robust and well-tested API.

The testing strategy encompasses both unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability and security of the API.

# API and Testing Strategy Overview

This document outlines the complete architecture and testing strategy for the API, focusing on its asynchronous FAPI-compliant nature, data models, and multi-tenant design. It also includes information about the specific tests for organization registration.

## 8. Testing Strategy

The testing strategy encompasses both unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability and security of the API.

```typescript
// src/utils/tenant.ts

/* Copyright (c) Connecting Solution & Applications Ltd. */
/* Apache License 2.0 */

/**
 * Validates a tenant's alternateName to ensure it doesn't conflict with the "host" name.
 * @param alternateName The alternateName to validate.
 * @returns True if the alternateName is valid, false otherwise.
 */
export function isValidTenantAlternateName(alternateName: string): boolean {
  if (!alternateName) {
    return false; // Or throw an error, depending on your requirements
  }
  const lowerName = alternateName.toLowerCase();
  if (lowerName === "host" || lowerName.startsWith("host") || lowerName.endsWith("host")) {
    return false; // Invalid name
  }
  return true; // Valid name
}
```

*   **Integration Tests:** Integration tests verify the interaction between multiple components (e.g., API endpoint, `OrganizationRegistrationManager`, and database). These tests are located in `src/__tests__/integration`.

### 8.1. Organization Registration Tests

The organization registration process is thoroughly tested with the following test cases:

*   **`src/__tests__/unit/OrganizationRegistrationManager.test.ts`:** Tests the `OrganizationRegistrationManager` class in isolation.
    *   Verifies that the manager correctly separates claims into different resource types (Organization, Person, Service).
    *   Validates the generation and validation of UUID v4 identifiers.
    *   Ensures that the "demo" environment is handled correctly.
    *   Handles different scenarios: existing valid UUID, invalid UUID, no UUID provided.
*   **`src/__tests__/integration/organizationRegistration.test.ts`:** Tests the complete organization registration flow, from API endpoint to data persistence (mocked database).
    *   Verifies that the API endpoint receives the request and calls the `OrganizationRegistrationManager`.
    *   Ensures that the data is correctly processed and persisted (mocked).
    *   Validates the FAPI compliance of the endpoint.
    *   Confirms correct handling of the `thid` for tracking the request.

## 9. Test Suite: Asynchronous FAPI Flow (`tenant.test.ts`)

This is the most critical integration test. It validates the entire secure, asynchronous communication protocol from end to end.
