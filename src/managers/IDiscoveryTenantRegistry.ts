/**
 * Tenant-registry contract specifically for public discovery/publication flows.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 * - discovery needs more than the minimal runtime-safe tenant interface
 * - but discovery does not need the whole hosting/control-plane surface either
 * - separating this contract makes the discovery dependency explicit and easier
 *   to audit
 *
 * Typical consumers:
 * - `DiscoveryService`
 * - public discovery routes under `/.well-known/...`
 * - catalog publication endpoints
 *
 * Security posture:
 * - this interface is still privileged compared to `ITenantsManager`
 * - however it should remain scoped to publication/discovery concerns
 * - avoid adding generic lifecycle mutation or unrelated hosting behavior here
