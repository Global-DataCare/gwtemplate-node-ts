/**
 * Read-only runtime resolver for non-sensitive tenant metadata.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 * - many runtime flows need only a small amount of tenant-derived information
 *   such as DID, URN, service endpoints, or authorization state
 * - those flows must not receive the full tenant registration object or any
 *   capability that could decrypt it
 *
 * What this interface is for:
 * - resolve already-derived, non-secret runtime metadata by logical `vaultId`
 * - support routing, issuer composition, and publication gating
 *
 * What this interface is not for:
 * - exposing raw tenant claims/config
 * - exposing database credentials, KMS material, seeds, or any future secrets
 * - serving as a write API for tenant registry mutation
 *
 * Who should use this:
 * - domain/runtime managers that need only safe derived metadata
 *
 * Who should not use this:
 * - code that must load or mutate full tenant registration records; that
 *   belongs in hosting/discovery/control-plane specific services with explicit
 *   privileged interfaces
 *
 * Cache policy:
 * - callers should assume this interface is backed by an in-memory runtime
 *   cache populated on first access
 * - ordinary reads should be served from cache after the first load
 * - writes must never treat the cache as the source of truth; privileged write
 *   flows must persist to storage first, then refresh or invalidate cache
 * - callers must not assume tenant metadata is immutable during process
 *   lifetime: lifecycle transitions and DID updates can change it
