/**
 * Privileged tenant-registry contract for hosting/control-plane flows.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 * - hosting is the part of the system that creates, finalizes, enables,
 *   disables, purges, and publishes tenant registrations
 * - those flows legitimately need broader access than ordinary domain managers
 * - but that privileged access should still be explicit and scoped to hosting,
 *   rather than passing the concrete cache/registry implementation around
 *
 * Typical consumers:
 * - `HostingManager`
 * - `HostingLifecycleService`
 * - `HostingOfferOrderService`
 *
 * Security posture:
 * - this is a privileged control-plane interface
 * - it should never be injected into normal entity/resource managers
 * - it is narrower than the concrete `TenantsCacheManager` type, even though it
 *   still exposes full registration reads and cache refresh
