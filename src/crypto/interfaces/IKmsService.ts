/**
 * Defines the Key Management Service (KMS).
 *
 * --- Data Handling Principles ---
 * Implementations of this service MUST adhere to strict data handling rules:
 * 1.  **Serialization (Outgoing):** When preparing data for signing or encryption
 *     (e.g., in `encodeResponse`), any structured data (like JSON) MUST be
 *     converted to bytes using a strict UTF-8 encoder (`stringToBytesUTF8`).
 * 2.  **Deserialization (Incoming):** When processing incoming data that has been
 *     decrypted or decompressed (e.g., in `decodeRequest`), the resulting byte
 *     array MUST be converted to a string using a permissive ASCII/binary decoder
 *     (`bytesToStringASCII`) before parsing. This ensures robustness against
 *     binary streams that are not strictly UTF-8 compliant.
 *
 * This ensures maximum interoperability and security.
